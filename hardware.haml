          # Supported hardware

          The hardware platforms we support are:
          * [Beagle Board](http://beagleboard.org)
          * [Gumstix](http://www.gumstix.org)

          These are the platforms we test our releases on, but we are working on
          supporting more platforms. It probably works on other OMAP35x-based
          platforms, but we have none available.
